When looking for machine and statistical learning project, I ran across [Best Practices for Using eBird Data](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebird-best-practices/index.html). It walks through using random forest to predict bird encounter rates for a given species in a given region.  To properly understand this, I'm walking through the tutorial.

```{e}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mstrimas/ebppackages")
```

This didn't work, so I assume that we'll be using _rebird_ and _auk_ and import the packages as we come acorss them.

This recommends getting the full ebird text file, but
