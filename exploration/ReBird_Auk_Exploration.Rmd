The packages that I always use for working with tabular data and visualizing
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

The birding related packages.  rebird returns 30 days of observations for most functions.  auk contains a far larger set from the same source
```{r}
library(rebird)
library(auk)

?auk_set_ebd_path
auk_set_ebd_path("data/raw/ebd")
```
